      <h4 class="prod-subtitle">The Spring White Truffle <span class="cursive"> (Tuber borchii Vitt.)</span></h4>
      <p class="main-text">The spring white truffle (<em>Tuber borchii Vitt.</em>) has a smooth, pale skin, which ranges in colour from ochre to dark orange depending on its ripeness and the terrain in which it is harvested. The flesh, on the other hand, is pale, with whitish veins when it is young and more reddish veins as it ripens. Unlike other types of truffle, its skin is fairly smooth.<br>
The spring white truffle is harvested and sold from 15 January to 15 April. <br>
It is often used to flavour broths and traditional meat and fish dishes. Its strong aroma is reminiscent of garlic and, like garlic, it can sometimes be difficult to digest despite its organoleptic properties. Its garlicky aroma is not released until a few minutes after it is has been cut, initially resembling that of the more highly prized truffle varieties.
This truffle favours coastal and maritime regions, growing in pinewoods and acidic sandy ground, as well as more mountainous areas up to 1000 metres above sea level, where it can be found under pines and downy oaks, beeches and poplars. <br>
The spring white truffle is less sought-after and more affordable than the more celebrated varieties such as the white truffle and the black Périgord truffle. However, despite its accessible price, it can turn the simplest of dishes into something truly special thanks to its characteristic aroma, which can even transform homely salads or broths into something exquisite.</p>
    <h4 class="prod-subtitle">The Prized White Truffle <span class="cursive">(Tuber magnatum Pico)</span></h4>
    <p class="main-text">The prized white truffle (<em>Tuber magnatum Pico</em>), also known as the white Italian truffle, is characterised by its golden skin, sometimes tending to ochre, and its highly irregular, slightly flattened shape. <br>
      This is undoubtedly the most sought-after of all truffle varieties, not just because of its marked and characteristic flavour, but also because it is a wild truffle that cannot be cultivated.<br>
The internal colour of the flesh (the technical term is 'gleba') takes on marble-like hues that range from pale yellow to red or hazel, varying according to the trees beneath which the truffles grow. In fact, truffles draw nutrition from the trees and exploit the life cycle of the plants, particularly the roots, to extract the substances they need.<br>
The white truffle is harvested and sold from 1 October to 31 December. Each region in Italy where this precious product grows has its own white truffle season, ensuring that it is always harvested at its very peak, when the flesh is firm and scented and the truffle has reached a sufficiently large size.<br>
The prized white truffle grows wild at any altitude. It favours slightly chalky ground, characterised by wet springs and summers, and grows particularly well in airy spots, fed by rivers and watercourses, from which it draws many of the nutritional substances that contribute to the unique aromatic flavour that makes it so popular with chefs from the world's top restaurants. The addition of white truffle makes a dish very special thanks to its unmistakable aroma. It is particularly suited to traditional pasta and rice dishes and its flavour is enhanced by simplicity.</p>

<h4 class="prod-subtitle">The Summer Truffle <span class="cursive">(Tuber aestivum Vitt.)</span></h4>
<p class="main-text">
  The summer truffle (<em>Tuber aestivum Vitt.</em>) has a rounded and particularly thick skin, meaning that it can be easily distinguished from the black Périgord truffle at first glance.<br>
   It can reach up to around 10 cm in diameter and is also easy to identify thanks to a small cavity at its base, which is flatter than the rest of it. The colour of its skin ranges from very dark brown to deep black. It is globular in shape, with small pyramidal shaped warts.<br>
   Its flesh varies in colour from white to ochre and hazel, depending on its ripeness and its area of origin. Truffle hunters seek out the much-appreciated summer truffle from 15 May to 31 August. Unlike other types of truffle, it does not release its aroma immediately. Indeed, a few minutes are needed to fully appreciate its characteristic scent with its subtle fruity notes. It can frequently be found on the surface of the ground and is not predominantly subterranean. <br>
   It often grows beneath beech and birch trees, as well beneath conifers such as pines and firs.<br>
   It grows mainly in conifer woods, at quite high altitudes varying between 1000 and 1400 metres above sea level. <br>Despite its comparatively low cost (compared to other more highly-prized truffle varieties), it is an exquisite accompaniment to meats and rich salads, adding a real touch of sophistication to the menu. Its subtle aroma also recalls the porcini mushroom. <br>
   Chefs normally use it to add a special touch to traditional Italian dishes, enhancing their aroma.

<h4 class="prod-subtitle">The Brumale truffle <span class="cursive">(Tuber brumale Vitt.)</span></h4>
<p class="main-text">
  The Brumale truffle (Tuber brumale Vitt.) is also known as the black winter truffle and is primarily harvested from November to mid-March.<br>
  It has a very dark, almost black skin and is characterised by small flat and globular warts. It can vary in diameter from 2 to 9 centimetres and has pale, marbled flesh with a tangle of clear-cut veins in two main colours: white and grey.<br>
  Expert truffle hunters know that the ideal habitats of the Brumale truffle are large deciduous woods or areas that are particularly rich in oak trees, from which the truffle draws nourishment and acquires its superb aroma and colour. It is usually found between 5 and 30 cm below the surface, meaning that it is harvested using specialist truffle-hunting dogs, who sniff out its strong and unmistakable scent. It favours very chalky terrain, but it can also be found in other types of soil and at lower altitudes than those needed for large-scale forest growth.<br>
  Although it is much more economical than the prized black truffle, it is still an excellent addition to pasta and rice dishes and to main courses, enhancing them with its characteristic flavour (it is also known as the strong black truffle because of its persistent taste and lingering aroma, reminiscent of turnip in some specimens).<br>
  It is particularly popular with those who love strong and decisive flavours. This species also includes the musky truffle (Tuber brumale var. moschatum De Ferry), which can be recognised by its persistent musky and woody aroma. This variety is mainly eaten raw in salads, to which it adds a piquant touch.
</p>
<h4 class="prod-subtitle">The Prized Black Périgord Truffle <span class="cursive">(Tuber melanosporum Vitt.)</span></h4>
<p class="main-text">The prized black Périgord truffle (<em>Tuber melanosporum Vitt.</em>) is so-called because of its dark skin and its flesh, which ranges in colour from very dark red to brown.<br>
  It has a roundish, warty appearance and is firm to the touch. It can reach a considerable size in ground particularly suited to its growth.<br>
The black Périgord truffle is harvested and sold from winter to spring, between 15 November and 15 March to be precise. During this period, truffle hunters harvest the most aromatic and flavoursome black truffles for restaurants and gourmets all over the world. When it reaches maturity, the prized black Périgord truffle is at its most aromatic, with compact flesh characterised by marbled narrow white veins.<br>
It grows beneath different types of trees, the most common being the downy oak, the hazel and the hornbeam. It is mostly to be found on the plains or in airy hillside woods, where the trees are spaced well apart from one another. This is because the black Périgord truffle needs light and good air circulation to grow into the exquisite product used by chefs in the preparation of sophisticated and aromatic dishes of many kinds.<br>
Its flavour is not as strong as that of the white truffle, with aromatic notes that tend towards sweetness, so that it is known by experts as the sweet black truffle. It is best suited to short cooking times and is therefore mainly shaved over dishes, transforming them into culinary works of art thanks to its unique aroma and delicious flavour.

<h4 class="prod-subtitle">The Burgundy Truffle <span class="cursive">(Tuber aestivum var. uncinatum Chatin)</span></h4>
<p class="main-text">The Burgundy truffle (<em>Tuber aestivum var. uncinatum Chatin</em>) is very similar to the summer truffle, but grows at a different time of year.<br>
  Its skin ranges from very dark brown to black, with small warts. It is harvested from 1 October to 15 March.<br>
Its flesh varies from hazel to brown in colour, with extremely ramified pale whitish veins.<br>
 It is much appreciated for its intense aroma, which is much more marked than that of the summer truffle, and it is used to flavour numerous dishes. The world's finest chefs often serve it fresh in dishes able to exalt its characteristic flavour.<br>
Like the summer truffle, it tends to grow beneath deciduous trees in terrain rich in humus. In fact, direct sunlight prevents it from ripening properly. The Burgundy truffle needs clayey, water-rich soil and favours trees such as the hornbeam and downy oak, which satisfy its nutritional requirements. <br>
Its scientific name <em>uncinatum</em> derives from the Latin term uncinatus due to the particular shape of its spores, characterised by membranes that, when observed under the microscope, reveal small hook-like filaments.
